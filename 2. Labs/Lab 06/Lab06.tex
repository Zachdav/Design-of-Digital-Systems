\section*{Lab Purpose}
	\paragraph{}
	The purpose of this lab is to continue and improve the execution of the previous lab, where we designed a finite state machine to control the taillights of a 1965 Ford Thunderbird using a physical switch to emulate the clock cycle. In this lab, we will leave the clock alone, but divide it by a considerable amount, so the LED refresh rate (AKA each clock cycle) can actually be seen by the human eye. The FPGA board we use has a 50MHz clock. To make this viewable, we will divide this so that the output on the board is 1Hz, or 1 second per clock cycle.

		The \texttt{Top\_Mod} file simply combines the two other modules (\texttt{Clock\_Divider} and \texttt{Thunderbird}) by calling them. This is mainly for convenience, and it will become much more necessary when we have more than two modules in one verilog project.

\section*{Experimental Results}

	\subsection*{Waveforms}
	\hfill
		\begin{figure}[h]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=.55]{tb_5.PNG}
			\caption{This waveform shows the clock divider converting a 50 MHz clock
			to a 5 mHz clock. So, our \texttt{Thunderbird} module would execute on every rising edge of the \texttt{Clk\_Out} wave (5MHz), rather than the \texttt{Clk\_In} wave (50MHz). This was not the desired clock for the Thunderbird blinkers
			and was not the clock frequency used in our demo.  We did this only for the 
			simulation to see that we could divide the clock cycle and reducing it to a 1 Hz 
			clock would not be visible on the simulation. The amount of time (1 full second) that would have to pass relative to the sheer size of our monitors would be far too large to view/screenshot.}

			\hfill
 
			\includegraphics[scale=.67]{tb_25.PNG}
			\caption{This is the same clock divider with a different divider just to show again
			how it works in simulation, which would not be able to show 1 Hz against 50 MHz. The FPGA clock can be divided by basically anything to achieve the desired output for whatever case. If we had shown the actual conversion/division from 50 MHZ to 1Hz, $1*10^9$ nanoseconds would have to pass on this waveform graph.}

\section*{Significance}
	\paragraph{}
			Bouncing was the main issue with the previous implementation in Lab 05, also, clock division is a very common and useful tool to turn any clock frequency into something smaller. Specifically for us, we wanted to divide a large 50MHz clock into something viewable and distinguishable with the human eye. Using a simple clock division module in Verilog, we were able to elimate debouncing caused by the physical switch, as well as tune the frequency of our blinker to our liking. This makes tweaking and testing much easier, and the final product looks much cleaner. 
\section*{Comments/Suggestions}
	\paragraph{}
		We liked how this Thunderbird lab was split into two parts, but at the time of the demo of the \textit{first} lab, we were quite confused on what to do with the debouncing. We felt wrong for not implementing a software debounce, as we did not even know it would be a problem until the end of the first lab, where it was almost impossible to demo a perfect transition of states on the swithces, and then we learned it would be fixed in the next lab.
\section*{Additional Lab Information}
	\paragraph{}
		None necessary for this lab.
