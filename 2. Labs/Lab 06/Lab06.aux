\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces These are our ideas for implementing the clock divider, as well as some psuedo code to help us better imagine it in Verilog.}}{1}}
\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces This is a schematic for the two parts of the code as well as the surrounding top module. The top module encapsulates all of the logic and the program can be run just as the top module. We made one edit to this schematic after taking a picture of it but before submitting it, which was adding a state register to the Clk\_Div portion, which is not seen here.}}{2}}
\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces This waveform shows the clock divider converting a 50 MHz clock to a 5 mHz clock. So, our \texttt  {Thunderbird} module would execute on every rising edge of the \texttt  {Clk\_Out} wave (5MHz), rather than the \texttt  {Clk\_In} wave (50MHz). This was not the desired clock for the Thunderbird blinkers and was not the clock frequency used in our demo. We did this only for the simulation to see that we could divide the clock cycle and reducing it to a 1 Hz clock would not be visible on the simulation. The amount of time (1 full second) that would have to pass relative to the sheer size of our monitors would be far too large to view/screenshot.}}{11}}
\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces This is the same clock divider with a different divider just to show again how it works in simulation, which would not be able to show 1 Hz against 50 MHz. The FPGA clock can be divided by basically anything to achieve the desired output for whatever case. If we had shown the actual conversion/division from 50 MHZ to 1Hz, $1*10^9$ nanoseconds would have to pass on this waveform graph.}}{11}}
